## 🎯 About Me

Hi! I'm **Vanesa Fernández**, a creative developer based in **Valencia, Spain**, currently diving deep into **Data Analysis and AI** at Upgrade Hub.

My passion lies in blending development and data to build systems that are not only smart, but also impactful. With a background in both **backend and frontend development**, and hands-on experience in **REST & SOAP web services**, I bring a versatile and detail-oriented mindset to every project.

### I focus on:

- 🌐 Developing dynamic full-stack applications
- 📊 Analyzing and transforming complex data into insights
- 🤖 Exploring AI and machine learning models
- 🔧 Integrating and maintaining scalable backend systems
- ⚙️ Working with CI/CD tools like Jenkins & Docker
- 💡 Learning continuously and evolving with the tech
